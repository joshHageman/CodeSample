# CodeSample
This code snippet comes from a project in which I scraped, cleaned, explored, and applied machine learning algorithms to a dataset of recent home sales in Philadelphia County. I created this class to reduce code repetition and increase ease of use/testing.

This class accepts data split into testing and training segments, as well as the original dataframe this data comes from. It is assumed that the data has already been cleaned and standardized before being used in the regression.
